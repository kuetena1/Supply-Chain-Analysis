# Supply-Chain-Analysis

## Problem Statement

The organization seeks to optimize sales, profitability, and shipping performance. Despite overall strong sales, certain product categories and periods show inefficiencies, lower profit margins, and variability in shipping performance. Key challenges include:

Identifying drivers of sales and profitability.

Addressing inefficiencies in specific product categories.

Optimizing shipping performance and reducing variability.

## Objectives

Sales and Profitability Analysis: Determine key sales and profit drivers while identifying underperforming products and categories.

Shipping Performance Analysis: Assess shipping efficiency across regions, sub-categories, and time periods.

Recommendations: Provide actionable strategies to enhance profitability, reduce inefficiencies, and improve customer satisfaction through optimized shipping.

## Steps Taken for Analysis

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

Consolidated sales, profit, and shipping data across product categories, time periods, and regions, and state

Standardized data formats to ensure consistency in analysis.

### 2. Sales and Profitability Analysis

###### Category-Level Insights:

Analyzed overall sales and profit trends across Technology, Office Supplies, and Furniture.

Examined the disparity between sales and profitability to uncover efficiency gaps.

Highlighted Technology as the top performer in sales and profits, while Furnitureâ€™s low profit despite strong sales indicates high costs or pricing inefficiencies.

Identified Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies as sub-categories with the highest losses.

###### Temporal Trends:

Evaluated monthly and yearly performance from 2014 to 2017.

Observed peak sales in November and December, with 2017 emerging as the most decisive year and 2014 as the weakest.

Detected high sales in March but with lower profit margins.

Highlighted November, December, and February as consistently profitable months.

###### Product-Level Analysis:

Identified loss-making products such as the Cubify CubeX 3D Printers (Double and Triple Head Print) and the GBC DocuBind P400 Electric Binding System.

### 3. Shipping Performance Analysis

Duration and Variability:

Analyzed shipping durations by mode, region, and sub-category.

Identified "Same Day" as the most efficient shipping mode with the shortest duration and minimal variation, whereas "Standard Class" showed longer durations with significant variability.

###### Regional Insights:

Found that the West region has the lowest median shipping duration and variability, making it the most consistent, while South Central and East showed higher variability.

Sub-Category Analysis:

Highlighted Envelopes for faster and more reliable shipping, while sub-categories like Bookcases, Chairs, and Copiers exhibited wider variability and longer durations.

###### Temporal Analysis:

Assessed monthly variations in shipping performance, noting February, March, and November as months with low durations and minimal variability. August was identified as an outlier with the highest median and widest range of durations.

### 4. Recommendations Development

###### Sales and Profitability:

Focus on expanding Technology offerings and marketing initiatives.

Investigate high costs or suboptimal pricing strategies in Furniture to enhance profitability.

Leverage the profitability efficiency of Office Supplies to drive additional sales growth.

Optimize operations during months with low sales-to-profit conversion or negative profits by addressing inefficiencies and unnecessary expenses.

###### Shipping Performance:

Prioritize "Same Day" shipping mode for high-value or time-sensitive products to enhance customer satisfaction.

Reduce variability in "Standard Class" by streamlining processes.

Enhance consistency in underperforming regions (South Central and East) by addressing operational bottlenecks.
